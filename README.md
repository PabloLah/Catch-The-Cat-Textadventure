## **Catch The Cat - A Text Adventure**  

*Catch The Cat* is a **text-based adventure game** developed in **Lazarus** as an introduction to **object-oriented programming**. This project was created in collaboration with **Paula Plenz** as part of a group assignment in my Informatics class in high school.  

The game follows a **lighthearted story** where the player is on a mission to **find a runaway cat** that has disappeared into a **neighborâ€™s house**. Players must **explore different rooms**, investigate **furniture**, and search behind and under objects while navigating through the house. Along the way, they encounter **mini-games, hidden Easter eggs, and unexpected surprises**.  

The game allows movement in multiple directions (**left, right, forward, backward, up, down**) and provides interactive choices that shape the adventure. The goal? **Find the cat!**  

This repository contains the **source code** for the game, but due to file size limitations, the full executable and assets are not included. If you're interested in **playing the game**, feel free to **contact me**, and I'd be happy to send you the executable! ðŸš€
